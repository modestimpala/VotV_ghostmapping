# Voices of the Void recreation for ghostreferencing 
Some stuff can take considerable amount of time to remap, especially if assets depend on each other. To save your time, and possibly open you to more game mechanics you didn't know about, this project will be populated from time to time with new entries.</li></li>
To use them, drag and drop Content folder to your mod project base, usually named VotV. it should already contain Content folder and they should merge, and new assets will appear in your editor.

## Warnings

Main point of this project is to properly replicate structs, since they are the hardest to map due name mangling. As of now, only **struct_settings** remains incomplete, though as I would love to guarentee guarantee smooth operation on others, unfortunately I can't. Errors *should be* happening, though I can't completely exclude them. At least project manages to build with them. 
<br/><br/>I await for your reports, in case something goes wrong while utilizing one of those structures.
